# Offline Video Kiosk Display

This repo is set up specifically for the six seasons project at the denmark environment center.
It displays a 3x2 grid of videos to display the project in an offline environment (e.g. at the shop or visitor center).

It was built on create react app for speed, and because we don't have any performance concerns running locally.

You could repurpose this by adding two directories in the `/public` dir:
 `/videos` a set of `.mp4` files
 `/thumb` a set of `.jpeg` images with a 1:1 video->thumbnail.
And then updating the list of videos in `src/config.js`

## Video files

To get this project running, you will need to add all video files under `/public/videos`
Video names must match the thumbnails images e.g. Durak.jpeg -> Durak.mp4

## Building the project 

To share this project, install `yarn` (google it) then run the commands:

`yarn`

followed by:

`yarn build`

Then opening the index.html file in the build directory will run the page. 
We have run this on a guest account on a USB drive (to ensure that files aren't deleted between logins).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
